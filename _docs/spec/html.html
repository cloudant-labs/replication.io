Below is the best specification/write-up of HTTP-based multi-master replication as it is used in Apache CouchDB.
Further work is to be done to describe and create a specification that broadly encompases all the various
implementations and provide a foundation for future work and iteration across all implementations.

<p>The <strong>CouchDB Replication protocol</strong> is a protocol for synchronizing
documents between 2 peers over HTTP/1.1.</p>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>The CouchDB Replication protocol is a synchronization protocol for
synchronizing documents between 2 peers over HTTP/1.1.</p>
<p>In theory the CouchDB protocol can be used between products that
implement it. However the reference implementation, written in <a class="reference external" href="http://erlang.org">Erlang</a>, is
provided by the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb/tree/master/src/couch_replicator">couch_replicator</a> module available in Apache CouchDB.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> replication protocol is using the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Reference">CouchDB REST API</a> and so is based on HTTP and
the Apache CouchDB MVC Data model. The primary goal of this
specification is to describe the CouchDB replication algorithm.</p>

<div class="section" id="algorithm">
<h1>Algorithm</h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Get unique identifiers for the Source and Target based on their URI if
replication task ID is not available.</li>
<li>Save this identifier in a special Document named <cite>_local/&lt;uniqueid&gt;</cite>
on the Target database. This document isn't replicated. It will
collect the last Source sequence ID, the Checkpoint, from the
previous replication process.</li>
<li>Get the Source changes feed by passing it the Checkpoint using the
<cite>since</cite> parameter by calling the <cite>/&lt;source&gt;/_changes</cite> URL. The
changes feed only return a list of current revisions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This step can be done continuously using the <cite>feed=longpoll</cite> or
<cite>feed=continuous</cite> parameters. Then the feed will continuously get
the changes.</p>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Collect a group of Document/Revisions ID pairs from the <strong>changes
feed</strong> and send them to the target databases on the
<cite>/&lt;target&gt;/_revs_diffs</cite> URL. The result will contain the list of
revisions <strong>NOT</strong> in the Target.</li>
<li>GET each revision from the source Database by calling the URL
<cite>/&lt;source&gt;/&lt;docid&gt;?revs=true&amp;open_revs`=&lt;revision&gt;</cite> . This
will get the document with teh parent revisions. Also don't forget to
get attachments that aren't already stored at the target. As an
optimisation you can use the HTTP multipart api to get all.</li>
<li>Collect a group of revisions fetched at previous step and store them
on the target database using the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API#Bulk_Docs">Bulk Docs</a> API
with the <cite>new_edit: false</cite> JSON property to preserve their revisions
ID.</li>
<li>After the group of revision is stored on the Target, save
the new Checkpoint on the Source.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Even if some revisions have been ignored the sequence should be
take in consideration for the Checkpoint.</li>
<li>To compare non numeric sequence ordering, you will have to keep an
ordered list of the sequences IDS as they appear in the _changes
feed and compare their indices.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="filter-replication">
<h1>Filter replication</h1>
<p>The replication can be filtered by passing the <cite>filter</cite> parameter to the
changes feeds with a function name. This will call a function on each
changes. If this function return True, the document will be added to the
feed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimisations">
<h1>Optimisations</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The system should run each steps in parallel to reduce the latency.</li>
<li>The number of revisions passed to the step 3 and 6 should be large
enough to reduce the bandwidth and make sure to reduce the latency.</li>
</ul>
</div>
